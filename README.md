Many players encounter a situation where they need mob drops but can't hunt the mobs because it is day time. This issue is especially prominent on servers. This mod hopes to solve this issue, and any potential disputes it may cause by providing a hunting dimension. The hunting dimension provided by this mod is eternally night, meaning that mobs can spawn all day long.

## Hunting Dimension Mobs
The mobs that spawn in the hunting dimension are not like the mobs that normally spawn in the game. They will have additional natural armor, higher amounts of health and do more damage. These buffs to the mobs can be increased/decreased/disabled by changing the config file. 

## Mob Farm Benefits

- Mobs killed have a (configurable) chance to drop additional loot. As if they had +1 looting applied to their drops.
- Mobs killed have a (configurable) chance to drop a (configurable) amount of additional experience.
- Dimension has significantly less cave generation, improving mob farm efficiency.
- Building mob farms in one dimension makes sources of lag easier to track down.

## Planned Features

- Item to allow the player to change the type of any biome within the dimension. Allows for easier access to biome specific mobs.
- Rare mob spawns that serve as mini bosses. Lighting creepers, mobs with armor.
